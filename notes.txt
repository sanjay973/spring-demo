Bean scope -

Singleton - one object is created and returned for every request

prototype - new Object is created for every request

Example : 
<bean id = "myCoach" class="com.springdemo.TrackCoach" scope="prototype">
    	
</bean>



Custom hooks for bean lifecycle : 

we can call init-method and destroy method. Means what to do when bean initializes and what to do when bean is destroyed.
Note : for prototype beans,Spring does not call the destroy method.

calling init and destroy method from xml file : 
see beanLifecycle-applicationContext.xml file.
